# :Framework:
## About
:Framework: is a simple implementation, that allows simple routing, MVC architecture
and exception handling. It's my attempt to build my own framework inspired by many
frameworks on the web, including Phoenix, Laravel and Rails.

The idea is to not use any libraries at all, except for the latest version of PHP.
Every piece of this framework is crafted by hand, and it has 0 out of project dependencies.
( Including JavaScript )
